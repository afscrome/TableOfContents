#Table of Contents plugin for Zimbra Social

The Table of Contents plugin  allows you to automatically generate a table of contents
for a wiki page, blog post, forum post or media file.

##Using the plugin

When authoring a long article insert the text "[toc]" (without the quotes)
towards the top of your article.  This will be replaced by an automatically
generated table of contents when users view your content.

To tell the addon how to generate the table of contents, you should use the
rich text editor to format the headings in your article to use the "Heading 2",
"Heading 3" etc. formats.


##Installation

Copy the compiled plugin to the bin directory of your community website, and the Job Server.


## BUILDING THE SOURCE CODE

1.  Copy the binaries from the /bin/ directory of your Zimbra Social community into the /source/TelligentEvolutionBinaries/ directory
2.  Open up Visual Studio and build the solution.
